    <dc:title>Civil War Diary of John W. Chambers, 1863</dc:title>

    <dc:subject>Chambers, John W., 1840-1863 ; United States. Army. Iowa Infantry Regiment, 15th (1861-1865). Company E ; Soldiers -- Iowa -- 19th century -- Diaries ; United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Diaries ; Iowa -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 ; Diaries</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>The diary contains brief entries detailing his experiences in camp, on marches, and at battle, as well as entries made while in the regimental hospital. The final entries recording Chambers&amp;#x27; illness and death are written in a different hand. The memoranda pages at the back of the diary include a note about his enlistment and other men who enlisted at the same time. Also at the back of the diary are notes about expenses. John W. Chambers (1840-1863) was born in Guyandotte, Ohio and later moved to Burlington, Iowa. He served as a private in Company E, 15th Regiment, Iowa Infantry from 1862 to 1863. The regiment was stationed in Memphis, Tennessee, and later in Louisiana and Mississippi, and they took part in the siege of Vicksburg. The regiment also worked on the digging of a canal to connect Lake Providence, Louisiana, and the Mississippi River. 
Chambers was taken sick with typhoid fever in July 1863 and remained in the regimental hospital until early August. He became ill again at the end of August and was taken to Lawson Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He died of typhoid fever in a hospital in St. Louis on 21 September 1863. He is buried in Jagger Cemetery, Danville Township, Iowa. Blank pages not included here.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Charles W. Chapman was a farmer from Grandview, Iowa. He served as a private in Company F of the 19th Infantry Regiment of Iowa Volunteers. [N.B.: the regiment number written on Chapman&amp;#x27;s diary is the 15th Infantry; however, it appears that he was actually in the 19th Infantry.] This is a handwritten pencil diary, detailing Chapman&amp;#x27;s daily life in the military.</dc:description>

    <dc:subject>Bussey, Cyrus, 1833-1915 ; United States. Army. Iowa Cavalry Regiment, 3rd (1861-1865) ; Pea Ridge, Battle of, Ark., 1862 ; Vicksburg (Miss.) -- History -- Siege, 1863 ; United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Personal narratives</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>Cyrus Bussey details his exploits as an officer with the Iowa Cavalry. Bussey refers to himself in the third person in this laudatory discussion of his experiences in the Army, including his involvement in the Battles of Pea Ridge and Vicksburg, as well as the occupation of Helena, Arkansas. Cyrus Bussey, a native of Iowa, moved to Bloomfield, Iowa, in 1855. After serving as a Democrat in the Iowa Senate, Busseu was appointed by Governor Kirkwood as an Aide-de-State and was charged with sharing the responsibility for the defense of the state. During the Civil War, he was appointed Colonel of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry.  After the war, Bussey was a successful businessman and lawyer in St. Louis, New Orleans, and Washington, D.C.. He was also appointed the Assistant Secretary of the Interior (1889) during the Harrison administration.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Civil War Diary of James Robertson, 1861 account book &amp;amp; diary</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Robertson, James</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Robertson, James, Iowa soldier ; United States. Army. Iowa Infantry Regiment, 8th (1861-1865). Company C ; United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Personal narratives ; Diaries</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>James Robertson was a native of Clifton, Iowa, in Louisa County. He was a private in Company C, 8th Iowa Infantry, was taken prisoner at the battle of Shiloh and hospitalized in Nashville, Tennessee&amp;#x27;s University Hospital. The diary details his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse. The collection contains three of Robertson&amp;#x27;s personal diaries: two personal diaries from 1861-1862 and an account book ca. 1860. Diaries detail his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse.  Although the diaries are preprinted with the dates 1856, 1858, and 1861, he appears to have used them at later dates than those for which they were intended.
Blank pages not included here are either blank or missing.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Civil War Diary of James Robertson, 1861-62</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Robertson, James</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Robertson, James, Iowa soldier ; United States. Army. Iowa Infantry Regiment, 8th (1861-1865). Company C ; United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Personal narratives ; Diaries</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>James Robertson was a native of Clifton, Iowa, in Louisa County. He was a private in Company C, 8th Iowa Infantry, was taken prisoner at the battle of Shiloh and hospitalized in Nashville, Tennessee&amp;#x27;s University Hospital. The diary details his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse. The collection contains three of Robertson&amp;#x27;s personal diaries: two personal diaries from 1861-1862 and an account book ca. 1860. Diaries detail his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse.  Although the diaries are preprinted with the dates 1856, 1858, and 1861, he appears to have used them at later dates than those for which they were intended.
Blank pages not included: 36-37, 39-62, 65-68, 82-86, 89.</dc:description>

The diary details his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse. The collection contains three of Robertson&amp;#x27;s personal diaries: two personal diaries from 1861-1862 and an account book ca. 1860. Diaries detail his travels, thoughts, purchases, and transcriptions of some poetry and verse.  Although the diaries are preprinted with the dates 1856, 1858, and 1861, he appears to have used them at later dates than those for which they were intended.
Pages not included here are either blank or missing.</dc:description>
